Changes made by DDL commands are automatically committed to the database and cannot be rolled back.\n",
        "Key characteristics:\n",
        "Defines the database schema.\n",
        "Affects the structure of tables and other objects.\n",

        "- Scenario:\n",
        "In a Customers table, the Email column should be mandatory because it is the primary way the business communicates with its clients. Applying a NOT NULL constraint to the Email column guarantees that every single customer record has contact information, preventing scenarios where a customer signs up but cannot be reached.\n",

        "- Scenario:\n",
        "In a Products table, you might use a unique Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) for each item. While an auto-incrementing Product ID might serve as the primary key, the SKU column must also be unique to ensure inventory systems can precisely identify each product without confusion. The UNIQUE constraint prevents two different products from being assigned the same SKU.\n",

        "In an Employees table, you might need to ensure that the Age of any employee entered into the system is 18 or older to comply with labor laws. A CHECK constraint can be applied to the Age column to enforce that the value is always >= 18, preventing the entry of records for underage workers.\n",

        "The main objectives of normalizing a database schema are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Eliminate Data Redundancy: Storing the same piece of information in multiple places wastes storage space and makes the database harder to maintain. Normalization aims to store every fact exactly once.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ensure Data Integrity: By removing redundancy, updates become simpler and less error-prone. If data is stored in only one location, you only need to update it once to ensure consistency everywhere.\n",
        "3. Avoid Anomalies: Normalization helps prevent common database anomalies:\n",
        " - Insertion Anomaly: Inability to add new data without existing associated data (e.g., adding a new course without enrolling a student).\n",
        " - Update Anomaly: Having to update multiple rows to change a single piece of data (e.g., updating a professor's office number in 20 different rows).\n",
        " - Deletion Anomaly: The unintentional loss of data when a related record is deleted (e.g., deleting the last student enrolled in a course, thereby deleting all records of the course itself).\n",
        "\n",
        "The First Three Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization progresses through several stages. The first three are the most common and practical for typical business applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First Normal Form (1NF)\n",
        "\n",
        "1NF sets the most basic rules for a relational database.\n",
        "- Rule: A table is in 1NF if every column contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and there are no repeating groups of columns.\n",
        "- Concept: Each cell in the table must contain exactly one value, and you cannot have a single column holding a list of items (e.g., a Phone_Numbers column with \"555-1234, 555-5678\").\n",
        "- Example Correction: A table that stores multiple skills in one column (Skills: \"SQL, Python, Java\") would be split so that each skill has its own row or linked table.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. Second Normal Form (2NF)\n",
        "\n",
        "2NF builds upon 1NF.\n",
        "- Rule: A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF, and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key.\n",
        "- Concept: This rule applies primarily to tables with a composite primary key (a key made of two or more columns). If a column's value depends on only part of the key, that column should be moved to a separate table.\n",
        "- Example Correction: In an OrderDetails table where the composite key is (OrderID, ProductID), the ProductPrice should be moved to a separate Products table, because the price depends only on the ProductID, not the OrderID.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Third Normal Form (3NF)\n",
        "\n",
        "3NF builds upon 2NF and is generally considered the goal for most database designs.\n",
        "- Rule: A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF, and there are no transitive dependencies. A non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute.\n",
        "- Concept: Every non-key column should depend only on the primary key, and nothing else.\n",
        "- Example Correction: In an Employees table, if DepartmentName is dependent on the DepartmentID, and the DepartmentID is dependent on the primary key EmployeeID, you have a transitive dependency. These department details should be moved to a separate Departments table."
